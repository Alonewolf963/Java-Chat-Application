# Java-Chat-Application
This chat application uses Sockets, Threads, and Web Services in JAVA.

This project can be mainly divided into two modules: 
1. Server 
2. Client

This project is mainly depended on client/server model. The client requests the server and server 
responses by granting the clients request.

Web-based chatting software is unique in its features and more importantly easily 
customizable.

Typically, programs running on client machines make 
requests to programs on a server Machine. These involve networking services provided by 
the transport layer. The most widely used transport protocols on the Internet are TCP 
(Transmission control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

TCP is a connection-oriented protocol providing a reliable flow of data between two 
computers. On the other hand, UDP is a simpler message-based connectionless protocol 
which sends packets of data known as datagrams from one computer to another with no 
guarantees of arrival.
